# Exercise 1.1 Ada Lovelace

The program template contains the following:

```python
def main():
  #write your code below this line

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The line `# Write your program here` is a line comment, and the computer will ignore it when executing the program. Add a new line below the line comment that prints the string "Ada Lovelace" and run the program.

The output of the program should be:

```plaintext
Ada Lovelace
```

**Note:** Don't worry too much about `if __name__ == '__main__':` at the moment. We don't technically need it for this program, but it's good practise to include it and it'll be clearer in later exercises. 

Once you've finished the exercise and see that it prints the correct string, return the exercise to Github via the submission process. After that, you can read more about [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), who was one of the first programmers.
